## Course Structure

This course comprises three parts:
1. Mechatronic systems and performance criteria
2. Sensor performance criteria and selection, including but not limited to
  - Thermocouples
  - Resistive sensors
  - Inductive sensors
  - Capacitive sensors
  - Piezoelectric sensors
  - Encoders
  - Tachometers, and
  - others
3. Actuator performance and selection, including but not limited to
  - Fluidic actuators
  - Solenoids and voice coils
  - Stepper motors
  - DC motors
  - Piezoelectric
  - Shape memory alloy actuators, and
  - others

## Course Objectives
The overarching goal of this course is to learn
- The basic theory behind many of the common sensors and actuators used in typical mechatronic systems
- How to define specifications relevant to sensor and actuator selection
- How to search for and select the best sensors and actuators for your design
- How to evaluate their performance as part of the design process
