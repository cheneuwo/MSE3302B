# Sensors

Without going into the physical principles of how these sensors work, here is a brief overview of a variety of sensors that we may encounter.

## Position sensors

### Linear variable differential transformer
<wiki:Linear_variable_differential_transformer>, or {term}`LVDT`, is is a type of electrical <wiki:Transformer> used for measuring *linear* displacement (i.e. position along a given direction). These sensors consists of three coils -- a primary and two $180^{\degree}$ out-of-phase secondaries -- would around a hallow tube. A moveable ferromagnetic core, i.e. an <wiki:Armature>, connected to the object being measured, slides along the tube. An <wiki:Alternating_current> reference voltage (the "excitation signal") is applied to the primary winding which in turn induces an <wiki:Electromagnetic_field> (EMF) signal into the two adjacent secondary windings.
